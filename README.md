Welcome to myFilmsDB. This project is a API Database that I built from scratch!

Objective: To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

Technical Features:
- Node.js and Express for the backend.
- REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data.
- Contains middleware modules, such as the body-parser package for reading data from requests and morgan for logging.
- Utulizes a “package.json” file.
- Database built using MongoDB.
- Business logic modeled with Mongoose.
- Provides movie information in JSON format.
- Tested using the tool -- Postman.
- Includes user authentication and authorization code.
- Includes data validation logic.
- Meets all data security regulations.
- Deployed and publicly accessible on GitHub and to Heroku.
